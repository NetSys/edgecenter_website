                <h2>A Framework for NFV Applications</h2>
                <p>
                By moving network appliance functionality from proprietary
                hardware to software, Network Function Virtualization promises
                to bring the advantages of cloud computing to network packet
                processing. However, the evolution of cloud computing
                (particularly for data analytics) has greatly benefited from
                application-independent methods for scaling and placement that
                achieve high efficiency while relieving programmers of these
                burdens. NFV has no such general management solutions. To this
                end, we present E2 -- a scalable and application-agnostic
                scheduling framework for packet processing.

                <p>
                E2 is made up of three main system components: the E2 Manager
                which orchestrates overall operation of the cluster, a Server
                Agent that manages operation within each server, and the E2
                Dataplane (E2D) that acts as a software traffic processing layer
                beneath the NFs at each server. The E2 Manager interfaces with
                the hardware switch(es) through standard switch APIs and with
                the Server Agents.

                <h3>Pipelets</h3>
                <p>
                E2 provides a declarative interface through which the global SDN
                controller tells each E2 cluster how traffic should be
                processed. It does so by specifying a set of policy statements
                that we call pipelets. Each pipelet defines a traffic class and
                a corresponding directed acyclic graph (DAG) that captures how
                this traffic class should be processed by NFs.

                <h3>Dynamic Scaling</h3>
                <p>
                E2 provides hooks for NFs to report on their instantaneous load,
                and the E2D detects overloads based on queues and processing
                delays. When the E2D detects overload, it splits the overloaded
                NF instance to lighten the load. This involves placing the new
                instances, setting up new interconnection state, and considering
                the affinity requirements of flows, so it is not to be done
                lightly. Pictured above is the traffic load at an overloaded NF
                instance and its corresponding new instance with migration
                avoidance enabled (original NF splits at 2s).

                <h3>Migration Avoidance</h3>
                <p>
                E2 employs a novel migration avoidance strategy in which the
                hardware and software switches act in concert to maintain flow
                affinity. This scheme does not require state migration and is
                designed to minimize the number of flow table entries used on
                the hardware switch to pass traffic to NF instances
