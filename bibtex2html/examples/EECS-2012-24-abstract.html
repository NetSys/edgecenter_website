<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In November 2011, we surveyed 57 enterprise network administrators,
primarily from the NANOG network operators group, regarding network
appliances or so-called middleboxes. We designed our survey with the goal
of bridging the gap between research and practice, by allowing the
experiences and concerns of network administrators to inform the direction
of our research. We asked operators about the number of middleboxes they
deployed, what the challenges are in managing middleboxes, how much
middleboxes cost, and what causes middleboxes to fail. Not only has the
survey data driven some of our own research, but we hope that once
published some of our conclusions will be able to guide others in the
research community. With this report, we aim to give back to the operator
community by reporting on our findings and conclusions.
