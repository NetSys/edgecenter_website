<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
We consider the problem of fair resource allocation in a system containing
different resource types, where each user may have different demands for
each resource. To address this problem, we propose Dominant Resource
Fairness (DRF), a generalization of max-min fairness to multiple resource
types. We show that DRF, unlike other possible policies, satisfies several
highly desirable properties. First, DRF incentivizes users to share
resources, by ensuring that no user is better off if resources are equally
partitioned among them. Second, DRF is strategy-proof, as a user cannot
increase her allocation by lying about her requirements. Third, DRF is
envyfree, as no user would want to trade her allocation with that of
another user. Finally, DRF allocations are Pareto efficient, as it is not
possible to improve the allocation of a user without decreasing the
allocation of another user. We have implemented DRF in the Mesos cluster
resource manager, and show that it leads to better throughput and fairness
than the slot-based fair sharing schemes in current cluster schedulers.
