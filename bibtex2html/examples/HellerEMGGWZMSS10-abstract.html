<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In this demo, we present Ripcord, a modular platform for rapidly
prototyping scale-out data center networks. Ripcord enables researchers to
build and evaluate new network features and topologies, using only
commercially available hardware and open-source software. The Ripcord demo
will show three examples of custom network functions, operating together,
on top of a 160-node cluster. The first is a routing engine that isolates
classes of traffic. The second is a dynamic network manager than adjusts
links and switch power states to reduce energy. The third is a statistics
aggregator that supports network health monitoring and automatic alerts.
The demo will be interactive, with a visualization of live parameters for
each link and switch, such as bandwidth, drops, and power status, as well
a control panel to modify the traffic load. We feel that an interactive
demo is the best way to introduce the research community to Ripcord and
get their feedback.
