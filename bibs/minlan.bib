abstract={Cloud computing environments impose new challenges on
access control techniques due to multi-tenancy, the growing
scale and dynamicity of hosts within the cloud infrastructure,
and the increasing diversity of cloud network architectures.
The majority of existing access control techniques were originally
designed for enterprise environments that do not share
these challenges and, as such, are poorly suited for cloud
environments. In this paper, we argue that it is both sufÔ¨Åcient
and advantageous to implement access control only within
the hypervisors at the end-hosts. We thus propose CloudPolice, a
system that implements a hypervisor-based access
control mechanism. We argue that, not only can CloudPolice
support more sophisticated access control policies, it can do
so in a manner that is simpler, more scalable and more robust
than existing network-based techniques.},
