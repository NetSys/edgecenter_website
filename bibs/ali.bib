 Title = {Dominant Resource Fairness: Fair Allocation of Multiple
Resource Types},
 Year = {2011},
 Abstract = {We consider the problem of fair resource allocation in a
system containing different resource types, where each user may have
different demands for each resource. To address this problem, we
propose Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF), a generalization of max-min
fairness to multiple resource types. We show that DRF, unlike other
possible policies, satisfies several highly desirable properties.
First, DRF incentivizes users to share resources, by ensuring that no
user is better off if resources are equally partitioned among them.
Second, DRF is strategy-proof, as a user cannot increase her
allocation by lying about her requirements. Third, DRF is envyfree, as
no user would want to trade her allocation with that of another user.
Finally, DRF allocations are Pareto efficient, as it is not possible
to improve the allocation of a user without decreasing the allocation
of another user. We have implemented DRF in the Mesos cluster resource
manager, and show that it leads to better throughput and fairness than
the slot-based fair sharing schemes in current cluster schedulers.},
