 abstract = {The CAP theorem showed that it is impossible for datastore
systems to achieve all three of linearizability, availability and partition tolerance. In this paper we investigate
how these trade-offs apply to software-deﬁned networks.
Speciﬁcally, we investigate network policies such as tenant
isolation and middlebox traversal, and prove that it is impossible for naïve implementations to enforce them without
sacriﬁcing availability. We conclude by distilling practical
design lessons from our observations.}
