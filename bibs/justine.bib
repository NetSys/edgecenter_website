    Abstract = {   Middleboxes, such as caches, firewalls, and
intrusion detection systems, form a vital part of network
infrastructure today.
    Administrators deploy middleboxes in diverse scenarios from
enterprise networks, to datacenters, to access networks.
    However, middleboxes are universally deployed under what we call
the `unilateral model', where middleboxes are deployed and configured
by administrators alone, for the benefit of hosts in a single domain
alone.

    In this thesis, we present two new deployment models for
middleboxes which offer new capabilities for middlebox usage as well
as new business models for middlebox deployment.
    Netcalls is an extension to the Internet architecture that allows
end host applications to invoke and configure middleboxes in any
network their traffic traverses; for example, we present a web server
that invokes inter-domain DDoS defense when it detects that it is
under attack.
    APLOMB is a system that allows enterprise networks (as well as
individual end hosts) to tunnel their traffic to and from a cloud
service that applies middlebox processing to their traffic, avoiding
the costly and management-intensive burden of administering
middleboxes in a local network.
    Netcalls and APLOMB allow ISPs and cloud providers (respectively)
to monetize their deployment of middleboxes by offering them as a
service to third-party clients; all the while presenting new
capabilities, in the case of netcalls by enabling application
interaction and in the case of APLOMB by providing better scalability
and easier management.

    We discuss both of these proposals and their benefits in detail;
we then discuss challenges and opportunities towards their deployment
and adoption.}
